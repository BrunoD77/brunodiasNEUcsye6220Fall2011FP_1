csye6220:
Fall 2011
Prof: Maurant

I had a lot of 'personal' problems while working on this project:
2 business trips (1 week in duration each) since the Final Project started. 
And believe it or not, the boot sector of my computer became corrupted during a power outage in my area.
This is not an excuse for what the project looks like, simply an explanation of why it is not much, 
MUCH better than what it is.

I believe I have met most of the requirements for this final project.

I believe my application meets the Goal stated in the "CSYE 6220 - Changes and Additions - Final Project" document.

Transfer of Source Code - I have exceeded this expectation as my web-application automatically scans the 
"server" for the location of the JavaScript project to be used. For future updates, I'd like to provide a mechanism to 
upload a .zip file and unzip it, then proceed as I have in this application.

Although you can viwe any class and then view the source code for that class in my application, the presentation is crude
at best, and there is no highlighting of functions or variables as it was requested. I would implement this in a future
update.

I believe my web-application meets the role specified.

Supported Views:
	Inheritance View
	Composition View
	Gloval Variables View
	Function Calls View
	Resources View
	Files View

This web-application DOES support parsing tho I did not imiplement ALL of the ways javaScript can provide OO through inheritance. 
I only focused on the code of the 'MainMenu' game.

I have used a combination of html5, css3, javaScript, and jQuery for my user interface, as well as php for the business and some UI
elements.

TESTING:
I have tested my project on a PC using Google Chrome. I HAVE NOT TESTED THIS PROJECT IN AN APPLE COMPUTER, BUT I DON'T THINK I INTRODUCED
ANY CODE THAT SHOULD BREAK IN A DIFFERENT PLATFORM. IDEALLY I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO TEST THIS ON THE ENGINEERING COE SERVER, BUT THE SERVER,
AS YOU MAY BE AWARE, DOES NOT SUPPORT PHP.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THIS APP.
	You must have 
		REQUIRED: XAMPP installed and running to provide services for this project.
			  You should have Google Chrome installed.

1) Open the folder where you keep the root directory for your javaScript code.
2) Copy the root directory of your java Script project. (For the final project, this would be “MainMenu”).
3) Open the folder where this php file resides. If you are not sure, check the following path:
      C:\xampp\htdocs\fp
4) Paste the entire folder into this directory. (for the final project this would be “MainMenu”)
5) Click on the Scan Button.
